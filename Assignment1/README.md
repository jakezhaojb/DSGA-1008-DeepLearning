## Policy
We expect you to try solving each assignment within your own team. However, when being stuck on a problem, I encourage you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject to the following rules:
* You may discuss a problem with any student in this class, and work together on solving it. This can involve brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going together through possible solutions, but should not involve one student telling another a complete solution.
* Once you solve the homework, you must write up your solutions within your own team, without looking at other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to others.
* In your solution for each problem, you must write down the team names of any team with whom you discussed it. This will not affect your grade.
* Please also follow the GSAS regulations on academic integrity found here http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/academic.integrity
